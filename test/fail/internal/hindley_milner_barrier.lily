SyntaxError: Cannot close over a var of an incomplete type in this scope.

# Lily has an ML-styled type system, I guess. I never looked into how ML works
# until recently. Wikipedia has a nice article here:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system
# "But where's the bug?"
# You're looking for the "free type variables" header. It explains what this
# code demonstrates.
# What this code demonstrates is rather simple: You cannot assume that the 'A'
# of another scope is the 'A' of the current scope. Lily's generics system can't
# quite handle this yet. I hate things that crash, so prevent that by gating
# what causes it off.
# The simple explanation is that f's A can be solved as something that may or
# may not be equivalent to h's A. Thus, trying to assign the two is a bad thing.

define f[A](f_input: A) {
    define g {
        define h(h_input: A) : A {
            h_input = f_input
            return f_input
        }
        h(0).to_s()
    }
    g()
}

f([1, 2, 3])
