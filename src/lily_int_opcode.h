/* Here are the interpreter's opcodes. There are comments here explaining what
   these opcodes do.

   The interpreter uses a register-based vm. When an opcode is written, the
   values it is interested in are written behind it. This means that some
   opcodes (specifically calls) have a variable length.

   These opcodes have comments that document how they work. All opcode follow a
   common format (see code iter's header). This common format allows code iter
   to present opcode data in a uniform way for other services to consume the
   information. */
