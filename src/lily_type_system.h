/* This is where the brains of Lily's type system lies. This handles type
   matching, unification, and solving.
   The type system (ts for short) works by having parser always tell it the max
   number of generics that any one function or class needs at once.
   How it works is by establishing a series of scope. Each scope has the max
   number of generics seen reserved into it. Matching will lay values down into
   the current scope, and will handle generics as it goes along. Resolving then
   later uses those filled-in types. */
