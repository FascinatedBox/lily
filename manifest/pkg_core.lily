### Pseudo root of all pre-registered modules.
###
### This is a fake module created to link together all of the modules that are
### automatically loaded in the interpreter.
###
### Except for the `builtin` module, all modules listed here can be imported
### from any file inside of the interpreter. This is unlike other modules, which
### are loaded using relative paths.
###
### The `builtin` module is unique because the classes, enums, and functions are
### the foundation of the interpreter. Instead of requiring it to be imported,
### the contents of `builtin` are instead available without a namespace.
